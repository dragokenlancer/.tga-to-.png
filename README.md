# .tga-to-.png
convert .tga images to .png recursively/bulk or individual files python3 

example:    
    tga2png.py -h #shows help screen      
    tga2png.py -r #will just recursivly go down all sub folders in the current folder and convert the files

I was working on a project for a friend and needed something that did this for alot of files so made this.
